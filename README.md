# üçü Potato Disease Detection

## Overview
This project aims to identify and classify potato diseases using machine learning techniques. By leveraging image processing and classification algorithms, the notebook provides an effective solution for detecting diseases in potato plants, helping farmers take timely action.

## üîç Goal of the Project
The primary goal is to accurately detect and classify diseases affecting potato plants by analyzing images of potato leaves. This project can be a significant step towards improving agricultural productivity and reducing crop losses.

## üìä About the Algorithm
The project employs a combination of image processing techniques and machine learning models to classify potato leaf diseases. Key highlights include:

- **Image Preprocessing**: Techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation are used to enhance the quality of input images.
- **Deep Learning**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented to extract features and classify diseases.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the model's performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
The workflow of the project consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Images of potato leaves are collected, encompassing healthy leaves and leaves affected by various diseases.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Resize images to a uniform size.
   - Normalize pixel values.
   - Augment the dataset to improve model robustness.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Build a CNN model.
   - Train the model on the processed dataset.
   - Use validation data to tune hyperparameters.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Test the model on unseen data.
   - Calculate evaluation metrics to assess performance.
5. **Prediction**:
   - Input new images into the trained model.
   - Obtain predictions for disease classification.
